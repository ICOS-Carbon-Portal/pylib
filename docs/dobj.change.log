Dobj change to read metadata from http request


- add new script to extract metadata from server
	metadata.py
	
remove _info1, _info2, _info3 from Dobj

change .info (consisted of info1,2,3,) and return .meta instead

references to server calls moved to constants

change .colNames
	returns now a list of strings with all variable names

license is extracted dynamically from the metadata per object.

citation is longer a property but a method, to allow for returning different formats

rename dtype_dict.py to dtype.py

print(Dobj) output of __str__ changed to plain citation string, instead of pid

add new property: .previous -> return the pid/url of the previous version of this file
add new property: .next -> return the pid/url of the next version of this file

rework of:
.data 	[property] returns all data
.get(columns=None)  [method] returns all data by default (this method is the shor name for .getColumns(columns=None).
Provides the possibility to extract specific columns from the data set. Expected is a list of column names, 
								which then returns only the selected columns. Non valid entries
								are removed from the list (if only non valid entries are provided, 
								by default all columns are returned)
.getColumns(columns=None) [method] this is the long name of .get(columns=None)

Please be aware, that `.data` `.get()` and `.getColumns()` will return ALL columns if executed on the Carbon Portal server.
