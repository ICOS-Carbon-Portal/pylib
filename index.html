                <h1 id="welcome-to-the-icos-carbon-portal-python-library">Welcome to the ICOS Carbon Portal Python Library</h1>
<h2 id="icos">ICOS</h2>
<p>The Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) is a European-wide greenhouse
gas research infrastructure. ICOS produces standardised data on greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere, as well as on carbon fluxes between the
atmosphere, the earth and oceans. This information is being used by scientists
as well as by decision-makers in predicting and mitigating climate change. The
ICOS Station Network consists of over 170 measurement stations in three domains
located in 16 countries in Europe. For more information please visit
<a href="https://www.icos-cp.eu/">https://www.icos-cp.eu/</a>.</p>
<h2 id="icoscp-python-library">icoscp Python library</h2>
<p>This library provides full metadata and partial data access to the data
objects hosted at the ICOS Carbon Portal
(<a href="https://data.icos-cp.eu/">https://data.icos-cp.eu/</a>). A benefit of this
library is to relieve the data users from downloading the files and
parsing their content. It is provisioned to Carbon Portal's
<a href="https://jupyter.icos-cp.eu/">Jupyter Hub</a> services, making it possible to
use supported types of ICOS data without installing any software.</p>
<p>To download full original data of all types, the users are referred to
<a href="https://data.icos-cp.eu/">data portal</a>
web application to find, preview and download the data objects.</p>
<h2 id="the-history-and-the-new-role-of-the-library">The history and the new role of the library</h2>
<p>This library has a history of being developed somewhat empirically, resulting
in mismatch with the Carbon Portal metadata model and APIs, and suboptimal
performance. Starting from version <code>0.2.0</code>, it is being put on a more
principled foundation in the form of a new library
<strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/icoscp_core/">icoscp_core</a></strong>, also developed by the
Carbon Portal. The new library is now a dependency of <strong>icoscp</strong>, meaning that
by installing <strong>icoscp</strong> one automatically gains access to all the
functionality of <strong>icoscp_core</strong>. As the latter happens to have all the
functionality expected to be <em>required</em> by most use cases, the majority of
<strong>icoscp</strong> code written prior to version <code>0.2.0</code> is being assigned a legacy
status. Legacy in this context means that it is not recommended for new
projects, but will be preserved to keep all the existing code, that depends on
older versions of <strong>icoscp</strong>, working in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>For new projects, developers are advised to consider
<strong><a href="https://pypi.org/project/icoscp_core/">icoscp_core</a></strong> as the first choice,
unless it is explicitly known that some specific <strong>icoscp</strong> feature is
required.</p>
<p>However, it should be recognized that <strong>icoscp_core</strong>, though making possible
with little code to achieve results that were previously impossible or lengthy
with <strong>icoscp</strong>, is a somewhat lower-level library. Notably, <strong>icoscp_core</strong>
does not depend on <strong>pandas</strong> library, which means the developers who want to
work with pandas DataFrames, may need to take one extra step (albeit short and
easy) to produce them from <strong>icoscp_core</strong> outputs. Additionally,
<strong>icoscp_core</strong> was designed to serve not only ICOS, but also other data
repositories based on Carbon Portal server software, which makes it
inappropriate to add much ICOS-specific functionality to <strong>icoscp_core</strong>.</p>
<p>Hence, the new role of <strong>icoscp</strong> library is three-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>keeping the legacy functionality intact, to prevent breakage of Jupyter
  notebooks and Python scripts that depend on the older library versions</li>
<li>providing convenient high-level ICOS-specific functionality, built on top of
  <strong>icoscp_core</strong>; future examples of that are:<ul>
<li>the latest near-real-time data for comparison across stations</li>
<li>concatenation of latest L2 release with corresponding latest
  near-real-time dataset </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>making all the <strong>icoscp_core</strong> functionality available as a dependency</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="icos-data-licence">ICOS data licence</h2>
<p>Please be aware, that by either downloading or accessing the data directly
through this library, you acknowledge that all ICOS data are provided under a
<a href="https://data.icos-cp.eu/licence" target="_blank">CC BY 4.0 licence 
<img src="https://www.icos-cp.eu/sites/default/files/inline-images/creativecommons.png">
</a>, and accept the licence. When using the library standalone (not on a
Carbon-Portal-provided Jupyter instance) to access the <em>data</em>, you are required
to authenticate as a user with ICOS licence accepted in your Carbon Portal profile
(<a href="https://cpauth.icos-cp.eu/">https://cpauth.icos-cp.eu/</a>). <em>Metadata</em> access,
on the other hand, is provided for anonymous users as well as for registered
ones.</p>
<h2 id="older-notes">(older) Notes</h2>
<p>The ICOS Carbon Portal provides persistent digital object identifiers for each
data set or file to improve the FAIR-ness of data and to give all the users
easy to use tools for provenance, citation and reproducibility, etc. Hence, you
only need to store a list of PID's (persistent digital object identifiers), or
you can use one of the built-in SPARQL queries, to reproduce always the same
result, regardless of the computer you run it on. You can share your code with
colleagues, without the need of moving data around. You bring the software to
the data, rather than data to the software. This is especially true if you
create a Jupyter Notebook hosted at the Carbon Portal.</p>
<p>You can follow the development on the 
<a href="https://github.com/ICOS-Carbon-Portal/pylib">GitHub repository</a>. Create an
issue to report bugs or request new features. The library has not been
thoroughly tested on many different operating systems and environments, hence
we appreciate feedback.</p>
<p>The library is developed with  Python 3.10, and we assume that any recent
Python distribution should work. If you have any trouble running the library,
we would like to hear about it.<br />
